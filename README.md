## 📚 About This Repository

This repository is the central hub for all my JavaScript learning materials. Each project is a self-contained application focused on practicing specific core concepts, with complexity increasing as my skills develop. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Vanilla JS before moving to frameworks.

- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Tools:** VS Code, Chrome DevTools

## 🏗️ Repository Philosophy & Approach

This is a **learning journal**, not a production codebase. The structure is organic and evolves daily as I explore new concepts. I prioritize **hands-on practice** over rigid organization.

### 🧭 Guiding Principles:

- **Project-Based Learning:** Each project is self-contained in its own folder
- **Progressive Complexity:** Projects get more advanced as skills develop
- **Practical Focus:** Building real applications, not just theory
- **Documentation:** Every project has its own README with demo and lessons learned

### 🔍 How to Navigate:

- Explore project folders to see practical implementations
- Check individual READMEs for demo GIFs and concept explanations
- Follow the commit history to see the learning journey timeline

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1.  **Explore Projects:** Each project folder is self-contained with its own README and demo.
2.  **Follow the Journey:** The projects are organized in order of complexity.
3.  **Learn from Code:** Feel free to examine the code and see the progression of skills.

## 🤝 Contributing & Feedback

While this is primarily a personal learning journal, suggestions and constructive feedback are always welcome! If you have ideas for projects or concepts I should explore, please open an issue.
